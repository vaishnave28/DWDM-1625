## **Apriori Algorithm in WEKA**

### **Step 3: Run Apriori**

1. Go to **Associate tab**
2. Choose **Apriori**
3. Click **Apriori → Edit**
4. Set:

   * `lowerBoundMinSupport = 0.33`
   * `minMetric (confidence) = 0.6`
   * `numRules = 10`
5. Click **OK**
6. Click **Start**

📌 **Output:**

* Frequent itemsets
* Association rules with support & confidence

---

## **FP-Growth Algorithm in WEKA**

### **Step 4: Run FP-Growth**

1. In **Associate tab**
2. Choose **FPGrowth**
3. Click **Edit**
4. Set:

   * `lowerBoundMinSupport = 0.33`
   * `minMetric = 0.6`
   * `numRulesToFind = 10`
5. Click **OK**
6. Click **Start**

📌 **Output:**

* Same rules as Apriori
* Faster execution

---

## **Step 5: Compare Results**

* Compare rules generated by **Apriori** and **FP-Growth**
* Rules with confidence ≥ 60% are **Accepted**
* Others are **Rejected**

---

## **Lab Record Conclusion (Write This)**

> Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms were implemented using WEKA.
> Both generated similar frequent itemsets and association rules.
> FP-Growth was more efficient as it avoids candidate generation.
