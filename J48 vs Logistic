## **c) Logistic Regression**

### **Steps**

1. Go to **Classify**
2. Choose **Functions → Logistic**
3. Select **Use training set**
4. Click **Start**

### **Output**

* Logistic model
* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix

## **Comparison**

| Algorithm | Model Type   | Accuracy | Interpretability |
| --------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------------- |
| J48       | Tree-based   | High     | Very easy        |
| Logistic  | Mathematical | High     | Moderate         |

## **Inference**

* Decision Tree gives clear IF–THEN rules
* Logistic regression gives probabilistic prediction
* Both predict categorical data effectively

---

## **Conclusion**

Decision Tree (J48) is easier to understand and interpret, while Logistic Regression provides accurate mathematical classification. Both are suitable for categorical data prediction.
