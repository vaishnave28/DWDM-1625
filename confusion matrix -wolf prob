## Step 1: Define the problem

We are **predicting whether a wolf is present or not** based on the boy’s warning.

* **Positive (Yes)** → Wolf is present

* **Negative (No)** → Wolf is NOT present

* **Predicted** → Boy shouts “Wolf!”

* **Actual** → Wolf really exists or not

---

## Step 2: Identify each situation

### Situation 1: Boy lies (joke)

* Boy shouts **“Wolf!”**
* **No wolf present**
* Villagers come unnecessarily

➡️ **False Positive (FP)**
(Predicted wolf, actually no wolf)

---

### Situation 2: Real wolf comes

* Boy shouts **“Wolf!”**
* **Wolf is present**
* Villagers ignore the warning

➡️ **False Negative (FN)**
(Wolf present, but prediction ignored)

---

### Missing cases (did not happen in story but needed for matrix)

* **True Positive (TP)**:
  Wolf present and villagers respond correctly ❌ (did not happen)

* **True Negative (TN)**:
  No wolf and villagers correctly ignore ❌ (did not happen)

## Step 3: Confusion Matrix

|                        | **Actual: Wolf** | **Actual: No Wolf** |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| **Predicted: Wolf**    | TP = 0           | FP = 1              |
| **Predicted: No Wolf** | FN = 1           | TN = 0              |

---

## Step 4: Interpretation (write this in exam)

* The system produced **False Positives** due to repeated false alarms
* It later resulted in a **False Negative**, causing real damage
* Loss of trust reduced model effectiveness
* Highlights importance of **precision and reliability** in prediction systems
