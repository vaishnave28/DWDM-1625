## **Step 1: Load Dataset in WEKA**

1. Open **WEKA GUI Chooser**
2. Click **Explorer**
3. Go to **Preprocess**
4. Click **Open file**
5. Load `weather.arff`
6. Set **Class attribute → play**

## **Decision Tree Classification (J48)**

### **Step 2: Apply Decision Tree**

1. Go to **Classify tab**
2. Choose:

   * `Classifier → trees → J48`
3. Select **Test option → 10-fold cross validation**
4. Click **Start**

📌 **Output Observed**

* Accuracy ≈ **92–95%**
* Confusion matrix displayed
* Decision tree generated

---

## **Rule-Based Classification (JRip)**

### **Step 3: Apply Rule-Based Algorithm**

1. In **Classify tab**
2. Choose:

   * `Classifier → rules → JRip`
3. Select **10-fold cross validation**
4. Click **Start**

📌 **Output Observed**

* Accuracy ≈ **85–90%**
* IF–THEN rules generated
* Confusion matrix displayed

## **Accuracy Comparison Table**

| Algorithm           | Accuracy (%) |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| Decision Tree (J48) | ~93%         |
| Rule-Based (JRip)   | ~88%         |

➡ **Decision Tree gives better accuracy**

---

## **Step 4: Plot Graph in WEKA**

1. After running classifiers
2. Right-click on result in **Result list**
3. Click **Visualize classifier errors**
4. Scatter plot of correct vs incorrect predictions is shown

(You can also take screenshot for lab record)

## **Conclusion (Write This Exactly)**

> Decision Tree and Rule-Based classification were implemented using WEKA on a categorical dataset.
> The Decision Tree algorithm achieved higher accuracy compared to the Rule-Based classifier.
> Hence, Decision Tree is more efficient for categorical data prediction.
